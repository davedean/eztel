for each lane,

where a new data-tick is present

if it does not have a different value than the previous one,

we can safely ignore that tick.

So we will end up with sparser data points in each lane, but more high-quality ones.

This should reduce the "stepped" look to the lanes.

And will be easier to create share links in future.
